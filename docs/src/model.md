# Model overview

GREB is a conceptual climate model: it solves energy and moisture budgets on a
fixed 3.75° × 3.75° grid (96 × 48), but takes the atmospheric circulation,
clouds, soil moisture and ocean mixed-layer depth from observed seasonal
climatologies instead of simulating them; the circulation does not respond to
a forcing. That keeps it fast enough for many simulated years while still
resolving where a forcing acts (Dommenget & Flöter, 2011).

## Prognostic variables

| Variable | Meaning | Unit |
|:---------|:--------|:-----|
| `Ts` | Surface temperature (land, or ocean mixed layer) | K |
| `Ta` | Atmospheric temperature | K |
| `To` | Deep-ocean temperature, the slow reservoir | K |
| `q` | Specific humidity of the atmosphere | kg/kg |

## Energy balance

The surface temperature changes with the sum of the heat fluxes into it:

```math
c_{surf} \frac{dT_{surf}}{dt} = F_{solar} + F_{thermal} + F_{latent} + F_{sense} + F_{ocean} + F_{correct}
```

- `c_surf`: surface heat capacity - the ocean mixed layer over ice-free ocean,
  2 m of soil over land, falling to 2 m of water where sea ice forms
- `F_solar`, `F_thermal`: absorbed sunlight, and longwave emission minus back-radiation
- `F_latent`, `F_sense`: evaporative cooling, and turbulent heat exchange with the atmosphere
- `F_ocean`: heat exchange with the deep ocean
- `F_correct`: flux correction (see [A run](@ref))

The atmospheric temperature and humidity have similar budgets, plus transport
by the circulation.

### Signs and units

Heat fluxes are in W/m². A term in a layer's budget is positive when it warms
that layer, so heat moved from the surface to the air is negative in the
surface budget and positive in the air's. Output fields at the surface (`sw`,
`lwdown`, `qlat`, `qsens`) are positive into the surface; `lw` is the
surface's own emission and therefore negative; `olr`, the longwave leaving to
space, is positive upward. Two internal arrays keep the sign of the original
code: the longwave emitted by the surface and by the air are stored negative.

## Components

Each timestep (12 hours, 730 per year) [`time_loop!`](@ref) calls
[`tendencies!`](@ref) for the radiation, hydrology, circulation and deep-ocean
terms, integrates the four prognostic fields, then updates sea ice.

| Component | Function | What it computes |
|:----------|:---------|:-----------------|
| Shortwave radiation | [`SWradiation!`](@ref) | Ice cover and surface albedo from `Ts` (albedo rises linearly as the surface cools through a band just below freezing), then the absorbed solar flux. Cloud albedo scales with the ISCCP cloud-cover climatology. |
| Longwave radiation | [`LWradiation!`](@ref) | Atmospheric emissivity from CO₂, water vapor and clouds (a 10-parameter log fit), then the up- and downward longwave fluxes. This is where the greenhouse effect lives. |
| Hydrology | [`hydro!`](@ref) | Evaporation by a bulk formula (four variants, `Hydrology.evaporation`), precipitation from humidity, relative humidity and vertical velocity (`Hydrology.rain`), and the latent heat flux (Stassen et al., 2019). |
| Circulation | [`circulation!`](@ref) | Transport of `Ta` and `q` by advection with the climatological 850 hPa winds and isotropic diffusion, plus moisture convergence for `q` from the vertical-velocity climatology. Runs 24 half-hour sub-steps per timestep, more near the poles; about 93% of the run time. |
| Deep ocean | [`deep_ocean!`](@ref) | Heat exchange between the mixed layer (`Ts`) and the deep ocean (`To`) by entrainment, detrainment and turbulent mixing. |
| Sea ice | [`seaice!`](@ref) | The surface heat capacity where sea ice forms; latent heat of freezing is neglected. |
| Forcing | [`forcing`](@ref) | The scenario's CO₂ and solar multiplier for the current timestep, from its CO₂ path and sunlight parts. |

## A run

[`greb_model!`](@ref) runs up to three phases:

| Phase | CO₂ | Purpose |
|:------|:----|:--------|
| Flux-correction spin-up ([`SpinUp`](@ref)`(years)` in the config) | control | [`qflux_correction!`](@ref) derives the corrections for `Ts`, `To` and `q` that hold the control at the observed climatology; without them the model drifts by several K |
| Control (`ctrl` years of the [`RunSpec`](@ref)) | control: 340 ppm (280 for the IPCC scenarios) | The reference climate |
| Scenario (`scnr` years) | set by [`forcing`](@ref) from the scenario | The experiment |

The result holds monthly means (`MonthlyRecord`s) of 15 fields for the control
and the scenario. The scenario is returned as an anomaly: each month minus the
same calendar month of the control's final year, except for the orbital
experiments and runs without a control. See the [Tutorial](@ref) for a run
and [Configuration](@ref) for the options each component reads.
